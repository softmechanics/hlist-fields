Nested record field accessors for HList, inspired by AstraFIN's fields package: http://github.com/AstraFIN/fields

Features:
  * Records are extensible.
  * Easy get/set of nested records.
  * Multiple record types can contain common field names.
  * Field labels are type-level strings.  This ensures that any two labels with the same name can be used interchangably,
    even if they were declared in different scopes.
